# scLRTC: imputation for single-cell RNA-seq data via low rank tensor completion
scLRTC is a Matlab package for imputing for scRNA-seq. The imputed expression matrix from scLRTC can be used for as inputs for other existing scRNA-seq pipelines or tools for downstream analyses, such as cell type clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization.
## Install dependences
scLRTC is implemented in MATLAB (version>=2017a). Please install MATLAB (>=2017a) before running scLRTC.<br>
The downstream analysis is implemented in R (version>=3.6.2). Please install R (>=3.6.2) before running the downstream analysis.<br>
## Usage
### Preprocessing
We recomend that user filter unwanted genes and cell before recovering raw data. By default, the gene expressed in less than or equal to 3 cells is removed. And we perform log-transform after adding a pseudocount of 1.
> Note: If there is a batch effect in the data, and the batch effect is not caused by dropout, it is recommended that the user remove the batch effect using other software such as [seurat3.0](https://satijalab.org/seurat/).
### Imputation
scLRTC() is the main function to recovery scRNA-seq data. We provided demo.m file to introduce how to change the parameters used in scLRTC. Here, Youâ€™ll get to know how to use scLRTC.
Initially, Begin by cleaning up the matlab environment:
``` matlab
clc;
clear;
close all;
```
Now, you should set the input file, a csv format file in which the first columns stores the gene names and the first row the cell names mandatorily.
``` matlab
input_path='YANDATA.csv'; %the dir of input file;
%the filr format should be '.csv',Cell and gene names are mandatory.
M = readtable(input_path,'Delimiter',',','ReadRowNames',1,'ReadVariableNames',1);
M0 = table2array(M);
``` 
Then, some optional paramaters can be set as below:
``` matlab
k=5;
%Construct the size of the third-order low-rank tensor
p=5;
%Construct the size of the third-order low-rank tensor
rho=1e-5;
%the initial value of the parameter; it should be small enough
epsilon=1e-2;
%the tolerance of the relative difference of outputs of two neighbor iterations
alpha= [1,1e-2,2e-3];
%the coefficient of the objective function, i.e., \|X\|_* := \alpha_i \|X_{i(i)}\|_*
```
Now, the thing you have to do is to invoke the scLRTC() function.
``` matlab
rebuild =scLRTC(M0,k,p,rho,epsilon,alpha);
```
The last thing you have to do is to save the result of imputation.
``` matlab
output_path ='yanltrc.csv';
%the dir of output file
csvwrite(output_path,rebuild);
%save the imputation result
```
## Downstream analysis
We provide the downstream analysis code and it can be found in the "analysis" folder.<br>
If you want to perform the downstream analysis, you can refer to the detailed guide(manual).pdf in https://github.com/jianghuaijie/scLRTC_guide.<br>
